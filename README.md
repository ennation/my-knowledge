# Introduction
## This site holds everything from my mind that I can think to put to words

This is my personal wiki where I keep everything I have thought to put to paper. 

This work is based on the structure and implementation of Nikita Voloboev's [Everything I Know](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) project. His personal wiki is amazing, and anyone visiting here should definitely check his page out.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

Please always keep in mind that this site is a living document, and that it is the product of just one person working on it for not much more than his personal aspirations. Pages may be in progress, or incomplete, and may contain personal opinions that you find yourself disagreeing with. 

[This is the summary file,](https://github.com/ennation/my-knowledge/blob/main/SUMMARY.md) which contains links to all notes contained here, and controls the order of topics displayed in the sidebar.

## Using my wiki well

## Grow your own digital garden ðŸŒ±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

I collected a list of [wikis I liked the most](other/wiki-workflow.md#similar-wikis-i-liked) for inspiration.
