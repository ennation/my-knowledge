# Introduction

This is my personal wiki where I keep everything I have thought to put to paper. I was inspiried by Nikita Voloboev's [https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) Everything I Know, so much so that I basically copied his beautiful implementation to get myself started. His page is wonderful, and anyone visiting here should definitely check it out.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals.

Below are [notes](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) & their relations visualized.

## Using the wiki well



## Other things I wrote and shared



## Grow your own digital garden ðŸŒ±

Such wikis are also called [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop [new transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).

I collected a list of [wikis I liked the most](other/wiki-workflow.md#similar-wikis-i-liked) for inspiration.

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
