# Wiki Reference

Since I am both releasing this wiki for other people to read and explore as well as for my own use. I have a small number of _rules_ of things I follow.

If you stumble upon anything confusing in the wiki, this place should ideally clear up any question you had.

## Abbreviations

I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean:

- QMK = [Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware](../keyboards/qmk.md)
- repo = GitHub repository
