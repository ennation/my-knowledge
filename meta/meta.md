# Wiki Structure

In the sidebar, you will find every note I have made for this wiki, as a markdown file, sorted into relevant folders. I continuously update pages here, as they are becoming a part of my personal usage as well. However, I try and write them in a public-facing structure, as if I am the audience reading. 

Each folder is a [topic that can include other topics](https://github.com/ennation/my-knowledge/blob/main/SUMMARY.md) under it related to the parent topic.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, you can just start reading from the top entry down and see what sparks your interest.

<!--
For super fast access of this wiki, I advise you to try out [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).
-->

If you find some mistake, especially if something that I say is just blatantly wrong, please fork [this repository](https://github.com/ennation/my-knowledge) and make a pull request with correct changes. Alternatively, if that is too much work or you are not familiar with Git, [open an issue](https://github.com/ennation/my-knowledge/issues/new) saying what you think is wrong.

Aside from GitBook search above and [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind), you can also use GitHub [file](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/find/master) & [text](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/search?q=karabiner&unscoped_q=karabiner) searches.

## Content Structure

Each topic will have a title, and relevant information roughly in the format seen below:

1. Title
2. A leading question: "What is this topic?", answered in the form of a general summary
3. My general information about it
4. Pros and Cons (if applicable)
5. ____: a note - quick notes about related subjects that tie in with the main subject
5. Links - Links related to the topic.

If you are interested in how I maintain and write this wiki, I wrote about it in detail [here](../other/wiki-workflow.md).

## Future

This project is still in its **extremely** early stages. Amassing enough knowledge to make this project worth anything will take time. Lots of time. I am a full time student, so as much as I wish I could sit down and write out a strong basis for this wiki in a few days, I simply do not have that kind of time.

1. Fast access to all this knowledge base. Achieved through:
   1. [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind)
   2. This knowledge wiki itself and the search it has.
2. Transcribing knowledge in terms that make sense to me and other people.
   -  I wish to make my mind's knowledge and expertise as _reusable_ by as many other interested people as possible.
